# House-Pricing-ML
A group project for an ML model using python for Machine Learning (CMPS 460) course

House Price Prediction using Machine Learning Models This repository contains Python code that implements various machine learning models to predict house prices based on specific features.

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to explore different machine learning algorithms and their performance in predicting house prices using a given dataset. The models included in this project are designed to learn from certain features and provide estimates for house prices.

## Features

The code includes the following components:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features for model compatibility.

2. **Model Implementation**: Implementation of multiple machine learning models, including but not limited to:
    - Linear Regression
    - Decision Trees

3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluation of model performance using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and R-squared score. Additionally, cross-validation techniques may be used to assess model robustness.
